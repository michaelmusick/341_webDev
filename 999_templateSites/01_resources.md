[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static website building tool.
This simple (relatively) tool allows you to use technologies we have been mastering all semester; Markdown (or Textile), Liquid, HTML & CSS. The build engine takes these and creates a static website for you to upload to your server of choice.
