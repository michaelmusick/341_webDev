		<h1>FLOATING ELEMENTS</h1>
		<h2>float</h2>
		<blockquote>"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving." - Albert Einstein</blockquote>
		<p>The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.</p>
		<p>Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated.</p>
		<p>When you use the float property, you should also use the width property to indicate how wide the floated element should be. If you do not, results can be inconsistent but the box is likely to take up the full width of the containing element (just like it would in normal flow).</p>
		<p>In this example, a blockquote element is used to hold a quotation. It's containing element is the body element. The blockquote element is floated to the right, and the paragraphs that follow the quote flow around the floated element.</p>
