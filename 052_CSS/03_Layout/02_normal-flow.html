		<h1>Normal Flow</h1>
		<h2>position:static</h2>
		<p>In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be:</p>
		<p>
			position: static;
		</p>
		<p>We have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.</p>
		<p>The paragraphs are restricted to 450 pixels wide. This shows how the elements in normal flow start on a new line even if they do not take up the full width of the browser window.</p>
