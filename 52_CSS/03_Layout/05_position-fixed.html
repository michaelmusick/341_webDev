		<h1>FIXED POSITIONING</h1>
		<h2>position:fixed</h2>
		<p class="example">Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.<br>It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. It is a good idea to try this example in your browser to see the effect.</p>
		<p>To control where the fixed position box appears in relation to the browser window, the box offset properties are used.</p>
		<p>In this example, the heading has been positioned to the top left hand corner of the browser window. When the user scrolls down the page, the paragraphs disappear behind the heading.</p>
		<p>The p elements are in normal flow and ignore the space that the h1 element would have taken up. Therefore, the margin-top property has been used to push the first p element below where the fixed position h1 element is sitting.</p>
