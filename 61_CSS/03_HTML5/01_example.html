			/*
			HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

			Many the <div> elements can be replaced by new HTML5 layout elements.
			For example, the header sits inside a new <header> element, the navigation in a <nav> element, and the articles are in individual <article> elements.

			The point of creating these new elements is so that web page authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page. For example, screen reader software might allow users to ignore headers and footers and get straight to the content. Similarly, search engines might place more weight on the content in an <article> element than that in the <header> or <footer> elements. I think you will agree that it also makes the code easier to follow.

			The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
			- The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
			- A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

			In this example, the <header> element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The <footer> element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions. Each individual <article> and <section> element can also have its own <header> and <footer> elements to hold the header or footer information for that section within the page.

			For example, on a page with several blog posts, each individual post can be thought of as a separate section. The <header> element can therefore be used to contain the title and date of each individual post, and the <footer> might contain links to share the article on social networking sites.

			The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

			For example, on a homepage there may be several <section> elements to contain different sections of the page, such as latest news, top products, and newsletter signup.

			Because the <section> element groups related items together, it may contain several distinct <article> elements that have a common theme or purpose.

			Alternatively, if you have a page with a long article, the <section> element can be used to split the article up into separate sections.

			The <section> element should not be used as a wrapper for the entire page (unless the page only contains one distinct piece of content). If you want a containing element for the entire page, that job is still best left to the <div> element.

			The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

			This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

			If a page contains several articles (or even summaries of several articles), then each individual article would live inside its own <article> element.

			The <article> elements can even be nested inside each other. For example, a blog post might live inside one <article> element and each comment on the article could live inside its own child <article> element.

			/*
			You already met the <figure> element in Chapter 5 when we looked at images. It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

			It is important to note that the article should still make sense if the content of the <figure> element were moved (to another part of the page, or even to a different page altogether).

			For this reason, it should only be used when the content simply references the element (and not for something that is absolutely integral to the flow of a page).

			Examples of usage include:
				- Images
				- Videos
				- Graphs
				- Diagrams
				- Code samples
				- Text that supports the main body of an article

			The <figure> element should also contain a <figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the <figure> element. In this example, you can see a <figure> has been added inside the <article> element.

			/*
			The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

			When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.

			When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.

			It may seem strange to follow these new elements by revisiting the <div> element again. (After all, the new elements are often going to be used in its place.)

			However, the <div> element will remain an important way to group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.

			Where there is no suitable element to group a set of elements, the <div> element will still be used. In this example, it is used as a wrapper for the entire page.

			Some people have asked why there is no <content> element to contain the main part of a page. The reason is that anything that lies outside of the <header>, <footer> or <aside> elements can be considered as the main content.
