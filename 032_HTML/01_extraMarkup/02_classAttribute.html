<!--
Every HTML element also accepts a 'class' attribute.
Sometimes it is more desirable to identify a group of elements by the same unique identifier. In this case, rather than use the ID attribute, you should assign these elements a class attribute.

This might be used to distinguish between to different types of paragraphs on a page, or links that you wish to be visually styled differently.

The naming conventions of the ID attribute should still be followed for the class attribute.

NOTE: If you would like to identify an element as belonging to several classes you can place a space between each class within the attributes definition string.
EX. class="important crazy_headlines" -> In this example the element would belong to both the important and crazy_headlines classes.
