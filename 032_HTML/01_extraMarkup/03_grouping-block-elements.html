			The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
			You might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for a header of your site, or to contain all of the visitor comments on a site.
			In a browser, the contents of the div element will appear on a new line. Other than this, it makes no difference in the actual presentation of the page.
			NOTE: You can use id and class attributes with div elements. These would then allow you to style the entire element and contents of the element easily within CSS.
			The last advantage of using div elements is that it can make it easier to follow your code by clearly breaking up unique sections of the page. (From a visual standpoint!)
			Suggestion: include a comment at the end of your div element to clearly identify the div section. (see line 24)
