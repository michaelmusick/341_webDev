<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
The Global Attribute
    or
ID Attribute

Every HTML element accepts an 'id' attribute.
This should be treated as a unique ID that can be used to identify each element. This may be used by CSS for styling, as we will see next week. Or, this ID attribute may be used by another language such as JavaScript to create reactive elements on your webpage.

ID's should follow typical variable naming practices.
-It should start with an lowercase letter or underscore (not a number or any other character.)
-It should not contain any spaces.

The ID will also always be formatted as ` id="id_name" `.
