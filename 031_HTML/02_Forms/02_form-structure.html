		<!-- We use the form element. -->
		<!-- action
			The action attribute is a link to the php, js, etc code on a server that will do 'something' with the user data before returning information to the browser.
			The value of the action attribute will always be an URL.
		-->
		<!-- method
			Forms can be sent using one of two methods; 'get' or 'post'.
			With the 'get' method, values are added to the end of the specified action URL. This methods is ideal for searches, or for retrieving data from a server (as opposed to sending data that will be stored in a database).
			With the 'post' method, values are sent in what are known as 'HTTP headers'. As a rule of thumb, use the 'post' method when;
				- users are uploading a file.
				- the data will be very long
				- the data is sensitive (ie. contains passwords)
				- Is altering or accessing a database on the server.
		-->
		<!-- id
			As with many other elements in HTML, you should assign a unique element ID that can be used by other languages to refer to the specific form
		 -->

		<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get" id="basicForm">			<p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>		</form>
