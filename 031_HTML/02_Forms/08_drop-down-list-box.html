			A select box allows a user to select one option from a dropdown list.
		-->
		<!-- option
			The option element is used within select elements to indicate each possible option. Any text between the option tags will be displayed in the dropdown box.
			As with other form types, the value="" attribute should be unique for each option element. This will be sent back with the select elements name attribute.
			The selected attribute can be used to pre-select an option. If this attribute is omitted then the first option will be pre-selected.
			Dropdown lists are very similar to radio buttons. However, these are more appropriate when a large amount of selections is possible (ie. "select a state").
