		<form action="http://www.example.com/add.php">			<!-- button element				The button element was introduced to allow users more control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button.				This means you can combine text and images between the button tags.			-->			<button><img src="images/add.gif" alt="add" width="10" height="10" /> Add</button>
			<input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />			<!-- input="hidden"				This example alsoshows a hidden form control. These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the browsers "View Source" option).				This input type allows web page authors/developers to add values to forms that users cannot see, but which will be sent along with the form to the server.				For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was n when the submitted a form.			-->		</form>
