		<title>How CSS Rules Cascade</title>
		<!--
			If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence.

			LAST RULE - If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence. Below you can see the second 'i' selector takes precedence over the first.

			SPECIFICITY - If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over the more general ones. In the example below:
				- 'h1' is more specific than '*'
				- 'p b' is more specific than 'p'
				- 'p#intro' is more specific that 'p'

			IMPORTANT - You can '!important' after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.

			Understanding how CSS rules cascade means you can write simpler style sheets because you can create generic rules that apply to most elements and then override the properties of individual elements that need to appear differently.
