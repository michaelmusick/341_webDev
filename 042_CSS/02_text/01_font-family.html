			The 'font-family' property allows for the specification of typeface to be used. The value for this property is the name of the typeface you want to use.
			The people visiting your website often need the typeface you have spcified installed on their computer in order for it to be displayed.
			Therefore, you can specify a list of fonts, seperated by commas, and if the browser is unable to find the specified typeface, it will work down the list until it recognizes a font family.
			It is common to end with a generic font name for the type of font.
			If the font name is made up of more than one work, it should be placed in double quotes ("").

			Designers typically suggest a maximum of three fonts on a page.

		<h1>Briards</h1>
		<p class="credits">by Ivy Duckett</p>
		<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
