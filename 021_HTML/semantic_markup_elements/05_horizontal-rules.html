<!-- Please note that line breaks `<br />` and horizontal rules <hr /> are known as 'empty elements'. An 'empty element' usually only has one tag. Before the closing bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. It is a good habit to get into writing these tags in this way. -->
