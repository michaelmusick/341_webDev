# SASS or SCSS or *SASSY*
SASS is a self-describe *sassy* version of CSS.
> Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

More specifically, SASS is a language that extends CSS with the power of variables, math, nested selector statements, and other 'modern' techniques.

HOWEVER! Browsers can only render HTML, CSS, and JS. So we have to 'pre-compile' SASS files to valid CSS files with a preprocessor.
This means we have to use our computers to compile the SASS file before we can upload it to our servers.

#### Install
To install SASS locally follow the directions from their website.
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com)

#### To Pre-Compile
Then run the following in your terminal, according to your specified directory structure.
`sass --watch styles/`
