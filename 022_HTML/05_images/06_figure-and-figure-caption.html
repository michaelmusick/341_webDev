			Images often come with captions. HTML5 intriduced a new element to contain images and their captions in a single element. This is known as &ltfigure&gt <!-- <figure>
			-->.
			<br />
			Use the figcaption element inside figure to specify the caption.
			<br />
			The figure element can include more than 1 image, as long as there is only one caption.
