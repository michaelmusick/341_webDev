        <h2>Formats</h2>
        <p>
            It is suggested that images with many different colors get saved as JPEG files.
            <br />
            GIF's or the PNG format should be used when a picture uses the same colors for large areas. Logos are often examples of this type of image.
        </p>
        <h2>Dimensions</h2>
        <p>
            The image you use on your site should be saved at the same width and height you want it to appear on the site. This will speed load time of your site, in addition to ensuring the quality of the image.
        </p>
        <h2>Pixels</h2>
        <p>
            Always size images according to pixels, not centimeters or inches.
            <br />
            Vector images, on the other hand are pixel independent. This is because the are defined by sets of points which lines are drawn between. This images do not suffer from rescaling or size issues, as they are rendered by the browser.
