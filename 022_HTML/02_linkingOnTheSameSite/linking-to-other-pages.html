			When linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as <b>Relative URL</b>.
			<br />
			This is the relative file path to additional pages in the top level directory or sub-directories.

			<ul>				<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>				<li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>				<li><a href="movies/der/blah/movies.html">Movies</a></li>				<li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>			</ul>		</p>
		<p>
			Relative URL's help with building a site locally before pushing it to the web. This way you can develope on your local machine, and still have links to pages be valid.
