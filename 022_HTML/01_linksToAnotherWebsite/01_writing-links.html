			Links use the &lta&gt tag. Within this tag, you need to include an attribute labeled 'href="http://michaelmusick.com"'. This is the actual URL of where you want to link to!
			The text between the link tags is what gets displayed on the screen.

		<p>
			Link text should be as specific as possible. So rather than a "click here", include the name of the site, a description, or something that provides the end user with detailed information.
