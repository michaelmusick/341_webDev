        <p>
            CSS stands for "cascading style sheets". <br />
            CSS allows us to style, or rather dictate the visual presentation, of individual HTML elements on a webpage. <br />
            Since elements in HTML as nested within other elements, we can assign CSS rules that will get inherited by lower level elements. <br />
            We can dictate style for the whole body element, or any nested element. <br />
            Furthermore, we can overwrite rules for lower level elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS works by associated rules with HTML elements. These rules specify how the contents of elements should be displayed. <br />
            A CSS rule contains two parts.
            <ol>
                <li>The "selector" - Which determines the HTML element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to multiple elements, in this case elements should be separated with commas.</li>
                <li>The "Declaration" - This indicates how the elements referred to in the selector should be styles. Declarations are split into two parts; a property and a value. These are separated by a colon.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
