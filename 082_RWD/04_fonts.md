# Fonts

We must be aware of line length and font size in responsive web design.

A rule of thumb for the number of characters per line for text viewed through a browser is 65 cpl (characters per line).

We should remember that we can set font size with breakpoints.

We can use the responsive columns of our site along with font size breakpoints to control cpl.
