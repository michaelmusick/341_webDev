		<p>The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.		<br />		If one box sits on top of another, margins are collapsed, which means the larger of the two margins will be used and the smaller will be diregarded.		</p>		<p class="example">Please NOTE: If the width of a box is specified then the margin is added to the width of the box. </p>
		<p class="example1">As with padding, you can also use the shorthand. </p>
