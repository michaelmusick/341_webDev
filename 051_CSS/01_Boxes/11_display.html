			The 'display' element allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice-versa. It can also be used to hide an element from the page.
			<br />
			<br />
			The possible values for this property are: <br />
			inline - This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element. <br />
			block - This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element. <br />
			inline-block - This causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block-level emenet. <br />
			none - This hides an element from the page. In this case the element acts as though it is not on the page at all. NOTE: the user could still see this element with "view source".
			<br />
			<br />
			This technique is often used to create navigation for a site, as in this example.
