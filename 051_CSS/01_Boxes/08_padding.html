		<p>The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.</p>		<p class="example">The value of this property is most often specified in pixels (although it is also possible to use percentage or ems). If a percentage is used, the padding is a percentage of the browser window (or of the containing box if it is inside another box).
		<br />
		<br />
		Please NOTE: If a width is specified for a box, padding is added onto the width of the box.
		<br />
		<br />
		As you can see, this paragraph is much easier to read because there is a space between the text and the border of the box. The box is also wider because it has padding.</p>
		<p class="differentSides">You can specify different values for each side of a box using: padding-top/right/bottom/left. Or you can use a shorthand, where the values are in clockwise order: top, right, bottom, left.
		<br />
		The value of the padding property is not inherited by child elements in the same way that the color value of the font-familt property is; so you need to specify the padding for every element that needs to use it.
